## How To Install 

You can install `cargo-chef` from [crates.io](https://crates.io) with

```bash
cargo install cargo-chef --locked
```

## How to use

> :warning:  **cargo-chef is not meant to be run locally**  
> Its primary use-case is to speed up container builds by running BEFORE
> the actual source code is copied over. Don't run it on existing codebases to avoid
> having files being overwritten.

`cargo-chef` exposes two commands: `prepare` and `cook`:

```bash
cargo chef --help
```

```text

cargo-chef

USAGE:
    cargo chef <SUBCOMMAND>

SUBCOMMANDS:
    cook       Re-hydrate the minimum project skeleton identified by `cargo chef prepare` and
               build it to cache dependencies
    prepare    Analyze the current project to determine the minimum subset of files (Cargo.lock
               and Cargo.toml manifests) required to build it and cache dependencies
```

`prepare` examines your project and builds a _recipe_ that captures the set of information required to build your dependencies.

```bash
cargo chef prepare --recipe-path recipe.json
```

Nothing too mysterious going on here, you can examine the `recipe.json` file: it contains the skeleton of your project (e.g. all the `Cargo.toml` files with their relative path, the `Cargo.lock` file is available) plus a few additional pieces of information.  
 In particular it makes sure that all libraries and binaries are explicitly declared in their respective `Cargo.toml` files even if they can be found at the canonical default location (`src/main.rs` for a binary, `src/lib.rs` for a library).
 
The `recipe.json` is the equivalent of the Python `requirements.txt` file - it is the only input required for `cargo chef cook`, the command that will build out our dependencies:

```bash
cargo chef cook --recipe-path recipe.json
```

If you want to build in `--release` mode:

```bash
cargo chef cook --release --recipe-path recipe.json
```

You can also choose to override which Rust toolchain should be used. E.g., to force the `nightly` toolchain:

```bash
cargo +nightly chef cook --recipe-path recipe.json
```

`cargo-chef` is designed to be leveraged in Dockerfiles:

```dockerfile
FROM lukemathwalker/cargo-chef:latest-rust-1.56.0 AS chef
WORKDIR app

FROM chef AS planner
COPY . .
RUN cargo chef prepare --recipe-path recipe.json

FROM chef AS builder 
COPY --from=planner /app/recipe.json recipe.json
# Build dependencies - this is the caching Docker layer!
RUN cargo chef cook --release --recipe-path recipe.json
# Build application
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release --bin app

# We do not need the Rust toolchain to run the binary!
FROM debian:buster-slim AS runtime
WORKDIR app
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/app /usr/local/bin
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/app"]
```

We are using three stages: the first computes the recipe file, the second caches our dependencies and builds the binary, the third is our runtime environment.  
As long as your dependencies do not change the `recipe.json` file will stay the same, therefore the outcome of `cargo cargo chef cook --release --recipe-path recipe.json` will be cached, massively speeding up your builds (up to 5x measured on some commercial projects).

### Pre-built images

We offer `lukemathwalker/cargo-chef` as a pre-built Docker image equipped with both Rust and `cargo-chef`.

The tagging scheme is `<cargo-chef version>-rust-<rust version>`.  
For example, `0.1.22-rust-1.56.0`.  
You can choose to get the latest version of either `cargo-chef` or `rust` by using:
- `latest-rust-1.56.0` (use latest `cargo-chef` with specific Rust version);
- `0.1.22-rust-latest` (use latest Rust with specific `cargo-chef` version).
You can find [all the available tags on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lukemathwalker/cargo-chef).

> :warning:  **You must use the same Rust version in all stages**  
> If you use a different Rust version in one of the stages
> caching will not work as expected.
  
### Without the pre-built image

If you do not want to use the `lukemathwalker/cargo-chef` image, you can simply install the CLI within the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM rust:1.56.0 AS chef 
# We only pay the installation cost once, 
# it will be cached from the second build onwards
RUN cargo install cargo-chef 
WORKDIR app

FROM chef AS planner
COPY . .
RUN cargo chef prepare  --recipe-path recipe.json

FROM chef AS builder
COPY --from=planner /app/recipe.json recipe.json
# Build dependencies - this is the caching Docker layer!
RUN cargo chef cook --release --recipe-path recipe.json
# Build application
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release --bin app

# We do not need the Rust toolchain to run the binary!
FROM debian:buster-slim AS runtime
WORKDIR app
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/app /usr/local/bin
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/app"]
```

### Running the binary in Alpine

If you want to run your application using the `alpine` distribution you need to create a fully static binary.  
The recommended approach is to build for the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target using [`muslrust`](https://github.com/clux/muslrust).  
`cargo-chef` works for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, but we are **cross-compiling** - the target
toolchain must be explicitly specified.

A sample Dockerfile looks like this:

```dockerfile
# Using the `rust-musl-builder` as base image, instead of 
# the official Rust toolchain
FROM clux/muslrust:stable AS chef
USER root
RUN cargo install cargo-chef
WORKDIR /app

FROM chef AS planner
COPY . .
RUN cargo chef prepare --recipe-path recipe.json

FROM chef AS builder
COPY --from=planner /app/recipe.json recipe.json
# Notice that we are specifying the --target flag!
RUN cargo chef cook --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --recipe-path recipe.json
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --bin app

FROM alpine AS runtime
RUN addgroup -S myuser && adduser -S myuser -G myuser
COPY --from=builder /app/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/app /usr/local/bin/
USER myuser
CMD ["/usr/local/bin/app"]
```

## Benefits vs Limitations

`cargo-chef` has been tested on a few OpenSource projects and some of commercial projects, but our testing has definitely not exhausted the range of possibilities when it comes to `cargo build` customisations and we are sure that there are a few rough edges that will have to be smoothed out - please file issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef).

### Benefits of `cargo-chef`:

A common alternative is to load a minimal `main.rs` into a container with `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` to build a Docker layer that consists of only your dependencies ([more info here](https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/fast-rust-docker-builds/#caching-rust-builds)). This is fragile compared to `cargo-chef` which will instead:

- automatically pick up all crates in a workspace (and new ones as they are added)
- keep working when files or crates are moved around, which would instead require manual edits to the `Dockerfile` using the "manual" approach
- generate fewer intermediate Docker layers (for workspaces)

### Limitations and caveats:

- `cargo cook` and `cargo build` must be executed from the same working directory. If you examine the `*.d` files under `target/debug/deps` for one of your projects using `cat` you will notice that they contain absolute paths referring to the project `target` directory. If moved around, `cargo` will not leverage them as cached dependencies;
- `cargo build` will build local dependencies (outside of the current project) from scratch, even if they are unchanged, due to the reliance of its fingerprinting logic on timestamps (see [this _long_ issue on `cargo`'s repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2644));
